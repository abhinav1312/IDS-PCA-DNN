# Technical research on intrusion detection in cloud

### About the project
- This was a college project where we were taught how to write a research paper and then we needed to write a research paper.
- The aim of the project was to research about how Intrusion detection systems are implemented in cloud and build an overall more efficient model.
- For the research purpose, I read 20+ technical research papers and got a good knowledge of the same.
- For my research paper, I chose to build a **deep learning model** based intrusion detection with the application of **"principal component analysis"**
for reducing the feature dimension.

### Language / tech stack used ###
**For writing research paper**
Overleaf

**For code**
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Sklearn
5. Seaborn
6. Tensorflow
7. Keras
8. KDD Cup 1999 dataset.


### Outcome
- Through the project I built a deep learning IDS model that was successfull in prediciting network anomalies with accuracy of 99.4% with other enhanced parameters of consuion matrix, F1 score, false alarm rates etc.
- I got to understand the network traffic, its analysis as well as various techniques and softwares used in the intrusion detection.
- Got great exposure to deep learning and principal component analysis which enhanced my machine learning and model building skills.
- Learned about deep learning, hidden layers, activation functions etc.

### Challenges faced
- Finding correct dataset.
- Network analysis.
- Model building and use of correct activation functions
