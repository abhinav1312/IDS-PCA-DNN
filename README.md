# Technical research on intrusion detection in cloud

### About the project
This was a college project where we were taught how to write a research paper and then we needed to write a research paper.
The aim of the project was to research about how Intrusion detection systems are implemented in cloud and build an overall more efficient model.
For the research purpose, I read 20+ technical research papers and got a good knowledge of the same.
For my research paper, I chose to build a **deep learning model** based intrusion detection with the application of **"principal component analysis"**
for reducing the feature dimension.
